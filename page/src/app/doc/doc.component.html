<h1>Page Composition Demo</h1>

<p>An Angular app is created with a App Module that contains a number of different components that are visually nested on the display.</p>

<p>The <b>index.html</b> file contains the head and body for the app module. All other HTML content is defined as
    components that are added to the index page.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>index.html contains the following components.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        app.component
    </li>

    <li>
        header.component
    </li>

    <li>
        footer.component
    </li>

    <li>
        main.component
    </li>
    <li>
        view.content.component
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Each component has a <b>TS</b> file that defines the settings used by the components.</p>

<p>A corresponding <b>CSS</b> file defines the styles needed by the component. In this demo we reuse
    the <b>app.component.css</b> file for each component.</p>

<p>Each component has its own <b>HTML file</b> to be used as a template.</p>
